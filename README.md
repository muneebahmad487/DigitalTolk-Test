## Thoughts about the code:

- Dependency injection is a good practice.
- The conditional checks based on parameters are good for handling different cases.
- The naming conventions and formatting of the code follow Laravel standards, which is positive.
- There is a mix of snake_case and camelCase in variable names, which could be made consistent.
- There is a lack of comments to explain the logic or the purpose of specific sections, making it less readable for someone new to the codebase.
- The logging setup is appropriate for keeping track of events.
- The some methods are doing more than one thing. This can be break down into smaller funtions.
- The conditional checks for user type could be refactored for better readability.

## What makes it good

- Dependency injection is used appropriately.
- Follows Laravel standards for naming, formatting and uses ORM eloquent relationships effectively.
- The code is modular, breaking down functionality into methods.

## What makes it okay

- The code could be more concise and readable in some places.
- The logic for categorizing jobs inside the BookingRepository could be separated for better clarity.
- The conditional checks could be refactored for better readability and maintainability.

## What makes it terrible

- The getUsersJobs and getUsersJobsHistory methods do more than one thing.
- The variable names could be more descriptive.
- The controller's logic might become hard to follow as more conditions are added.
- The code mixes business logic with the controller, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

## How would I have done it:

- I would consider breaking down the methods into smaller, more focused functions.
- I might consider extracting the conditional checks for user type into separate methods to improve readability.
- I would ensure consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
